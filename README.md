# Rigid_patchy_particles
Repository of analysis codes used for the rigid two patch system. 
Code include subroutines to calculated the following:
1. Distance matrix between the particles
2. Chain length distribution
3. Average chain length
4. Orientation of the chains
5. radial distribution function
6. Chain dynamics stats
